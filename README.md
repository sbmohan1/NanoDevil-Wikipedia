NanoDevil-Wikipedia
===================
NanoDevils was a DNA sequencing research team at Arizona State University. Mostly comprised of Biology majors, I was the lone Computer Science major in charge of designing the website that would showcase the research that the team had done. We entered Harvard's annual BIOMOD competition which is comprised of teams from around the world, to showcase their research. We placed in Gold at the conclusion of the competition.
